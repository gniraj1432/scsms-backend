🚀 **Smart Cleanliness and Sanitation Management System (SCSMS)**

**SCSMS** is a sanitation management platform designed to enable users to report unclean areas by submitting images and tracking locations via IP-based geolocation. The system streamlines municipal (**BMC**) response efficiency by providing **real-time status updates, role-based authentication, and a scalable waste management solution**.

## **🚀 Get Started**

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Set up `.env` files
4. Run with `npm run dev`

### **Clone the Repository**

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gniraj1432/scsms-backend.git
cd scsms-backend
```

### **Clone Frontend Repository if Needed**

```sh

## **To Run the Application on localhost**

### **Check Port 8082**

Make sure nothing is running on **port 8082** in the background. If something is using it, either stop the process or update the port in both the Java backend and React frontend.

### **Run Java Application**

```sh
# Navigate to the Java application directory
cd scsms-backend/src/main/java/com/springboot/application

# Run the Spring Boot application
mvn clean install
java -jar target/*.jar
```

**Alternatively, you can run the Java application from your IDE:**
1. Open your project in **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Navigate to `ScsmsApplication.java` in `src/main/java/com/springboot/application/`.
3. Right-click on the file and select **Run As > Java Application**.

### **Run React Application**

```sh
# Fetch all branches
git fetch  

# Switch to the 'react' branch
git checkout react  

# Pull the latest changes from the 'react' branch
git pull origin react  

# Install dependencies and start the frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### **Possible Issues & Solutions After `npm install`**

- **Deprecation Warnings:** These can be ignored as they don't affect app functionality.
- **Missing Babel Plugin Warning:** If this appears, it doesn’t impact the app.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Some vulnerabilities may be detected. The app runs fine, but it’s recommended to fix them later.
